## Signing the APK

To sign the APK for distribution, follow these steps:

1. Create a keystore if you don't already have one:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore degoogled-android-auto.keystore -alias degoogled-android-auto -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

2. Sign the APK using the keystore:

```bash
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore degoogled-android-auto.keystore degoogled-android-auto.apk degoogled-android-auto
```

3. Verify the signed APK:

```bash
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs degoogled-android-auto.apk
```

4. Align the APK:

```bash
zipalign -v 4 degoogled-android-auto.apk degoogled-android-auto-aligned.apk
```
