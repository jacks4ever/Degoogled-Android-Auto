# Security Guide

This guide explains the security aspects of the Degoogled Android Auto implementation.

## Overview

The Degoogled Android Auto implementation includes several security features to ensure secure communication between the phone and the head unit. These features include:

- **Encryption**: All communication between the phone and the head unit is encrypted.
- **Authentication**: The phone and head unit authenticate each other before establishing a connection.
- **Certificate Management**: Certificates are used for authentication and encryption.

## Security Components

The security components are located in the `src/protocol_handler/security/` directory and include:

- **ICryptoProvider**: Interface for crypto providers.
- **OpenSSLCryptoProvider**: OpenSSL implementation of the crypto provider interface.
- **AuthenticationManager**: Manages authentication with the head unit.
- **CertificateManager**: Manages certificates for authentication.

## Encryption

All communication between the phone and the head unit is encrypted using TLS. The `OpenSSLCryptoProvider` class provides encryption and decryption services using OpenSSL.

### Encryption Flow

1. The phone and head unit establish a connection.
2. The phone and head unit authenticate each other.
3. The phone and head unit negotiate encryption parameters.
4. All subsequent communication is encrypted.

### Encryption Implementation

The `OpenSSLCryptoProvider` class implements the `ICryptoProvider` interface and provides encryption and decryption services using OpenSSL. It includes methods for:

- **Encrypting Data**: Encrypts data using the negotiated encryption parameters.
- **Decrypting Data**: Decrypts data using the negotiated encryption parameters.
- **Signing Data**: Signs data using the private key.
- **Verifying Signatures**: Verifies signatures using the public key.
- **Generating Nonces**: Generates random nonces for use in encryption.

## Authentication

The phone and head unit authenticate each other before establishing a connection. The `AuthenticationManager` class manages the authentication process.

### Authentication Flow

1. The head unit sends an authentication start message.
2. The authentication manager receives the message and extracts the certificate.
3. The certificate manager verifies the certificate.
4. The authentication manager sends an authentication status message.
5. The head unit sends an authentication complete message.
6. The authentication manager updates the authentication status.

### Authentication Implementation

The `AuthenticationManager` class implements the `IMessageHandler` interface and handles authentication messages. It includes methods for:

- **Handling Authentication Start Messages**: Processes authentication start messages from the head unit.
- **Handling Authentication Status Messages**: Processes authentication status messages from the head unit.
- **Starting Authentication**: Initiates the authentication process.
- **Checking Authentication Status**: Checks if the phone and head unit are authenticated.

## Certificate Management

Certificates are used for authentication and encryption. The `CertificateManager` class manages certificates.

### Certificate Flow

1. The certificate manager generates a self-signed certificate for the phone.
2. The phone sends its certificate to the head unit during authentication.
3. The head unit verifies the phone's certificate.
4. The head unit sends its certificate to the phone during authentication.
5. The phone verifies the head unit's certificate.

### Certificate Implementation

The `CertificateManager` class provides certificate management services. It includes methods for:

- **Generating Self-Signed Certificates**: Generates self-signed certificates for the phone.
- **Verifying Certificates**: Verifies certificates from the head unit.
- **Loading Certificates**: Loads certificates from files.
- **Saving Certificates**: Saves certificates to files.

## Security Best Practices

When extending or customizing the Degoogled Android Auto implementation, follow these security best practices:

- **Use Secure Communication**: Always use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for communication between the phone and the head unit.
- **Validate Certificates**: Always validate certificates before establishing a connection.
- **Protect Private Keys**: Keep private keys secure and never expose them.
- **Use Strong Encryption**: Use strong encryption algorithms and key sizes.
- **Handle Errors Securely**: Handle security-related errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive information.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Keep security-related dependencies (e.g., OpenSSL) updated to the latest secure versions.
- **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant the minimum privileges necessary for each component.
- **Implement Proper Authentication**: Ensure proper authentication before allowing access to sensitive functionality.
- **Protect User Data**: Protect user data, such as contacts and messages, from unauthorized access.
- **Audit Security Code**: Regularly audit security-related code for vulnerabilities.

## Security Considerations

When implementing or extending the Degoogled Android Auto implementation, consider the following security aspects:

- **Certificate Validation**: Ensure that certificates are properly validated before establishing a connection.
- **Encryption Strength**: Use strong encryption algorithms and key sizes to protect communication.
- **Authentication Mechanisms**: Implement robust authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Privacy Protection**: Protect user privacy by minimizing data collection and ensuring secure data handling.
- **Secure Storage**: Store sensitive data, such as certificates and private keys, securely.
- **Secure Communication**: Ensure that all communication between the phone and the head unit is encrypted.
- **Error Handling**: Handle security-related errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive information.
- **Dependency Management**: Keep security-related dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
- **Code Review**: Regularly review security-related code for vulnerabilities.
- **Security Testing**: Conduct security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

By following the security guidelines and best practices outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your Degoogled Android Auto implementation is secure and protects user privacy.
