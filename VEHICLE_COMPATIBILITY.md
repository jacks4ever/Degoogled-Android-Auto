### Setup Instructions for Nissan Pathfinder

1. Install the Degoogled Android Auto APK on your device.

5. If the connection isn't established automatically, tap "Connect" in the app's menu.
6. On the vehicle's display, select the Android Auto option if it doesn't launch automatically.

### Troubleshooting Nissan Pathfinder Connection

If the connection is not established:

1. **USB Cable Issues**: Try using different USB cables - many cables are charge-only and don't support data transfer. Use the cable that came with your phone or a certified USB data cable.
2. **USB Port Selection**: Try different USB ports in your Pathfinder - some may be charge-only.
3. **App Permissions**: Ensure all permissions are granted in the app settings.
4. **Export Logs**: Use the "Export Logs" option in the app menu to save connection logs, which can help diagnose issues.
5. **Restart Sequence**: Try this specific restart sequence:
   - Disconnect the USB cable
   - Close the app completely
   - Restart your phone
   - Restart your vehicle's infotainment system (turn off the vehicle, wait 30 seconds, then restart)
   - Launch the app first, then connect the USB cable

### Known Limitations with Nissan Pathfinder

1. **First-time Connection**: The first connection attempt may fail as the app learns the specific characteristics of your vehicle. Disconnect and reconnect to resolve.
