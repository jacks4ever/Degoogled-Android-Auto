```

#### 4. Vehicle Connection Process

**First Connection:**
1. Start your Pathfinder and ensure head unit is on
2. Connect phone via USB cable to center console port
3. On phone: Open Degoogled Android Auto app
4. On head unit: Look for Android Auto icon/prompt
5. Follow on-screen pairing instructions

**Subsequent Connections:**
1. Connect USB cable
2. Android Auto should launch automatically
3. If not, tap Android Auto icon on head unit

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

#### "Device Not Recognized"
**Symptoms**: Head unit doesn't detect phone
**Solutions**:
1. Try a different USB cable (ensure data transfer capability)
2. Clean USB ports on both phone and vehicle
3. Restart head unit (hold power button 10+ seconds)
4. Check phone's USB connection mode (should be "File Transfer" or "MTP")

#### "App Not Installed" Error
**Symptoms**: APK won't install
**Solutions**:
1. Enable "Unknown Sources" in Android settings
2. Ensure APK is properly signed (check with `apksigner verify`)
3. Clear package installer cache
4. Try installing via ADB: `adb install -r app-release.apk`

#### "Connection Failed" After USB Detection
**Symptoms**: Phone detected but Android Auto won't start
**Solutions**:
1. Check app permissions (all required permissions granted)
2. Restart Degoogled Android Auto app
3. Clear app cache and data
4. Check logs: `adb logcat | grep DegoogledAA`

### Authentication Issues

#### "Handshake Failed"
**Symptoms**: Connection starts but fails during setup
**Solutions**:
1. Enable verbose logging in app settings
2. Try different protocol versions (app will auto-retry)
3. Check for Nissan software updates
4. Export logs and check for specific error patterns

#### "Protocol Negotiation Error"
**Symptoms**: Connection established but features don't work
**Solutions**:
1. Restart both phone and head unit
2. Clear Android Auto cache on head unit (Settings > Apps > Android Auto > Storage)
3. Try minimal feature set (disable advanced features temporarily)

### Display Issues

#### "UI Elements Too Small"
**Symptoms**: Text and buttons difficult to see/touch
**Solutions**:
1. App automatically detects display size and adjusts
2. Force larger touch targets in app settings
3. Increase font scaling in Android accessibility settings

#### "Screen Orientation Wrong"
**Symptoms**: Portrait mode on landscape display
**Solutions**:
1. App forces landscape mode for automotive use
2. Check head unit display settings
3. Restart connection process

### App Integration Issues

#### "OsmAnd Not Working"
**Symptoms**: Navigation requests fail
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure OsmAnd is set as default navigation app
2. Grant location permissions to both apps
3. Download offline maps for your area
4. Check OsmAnd Android Auto compatibility settings

#### "VLC Media Not Playing"
**Symptoms**: Music/media controls don't work
**Solutions**:
1. Grant storage permissions to VLC
2. Refresh VLC media library
3. Check supported audio formats
4. Try alternative media apps (Poweramp, etc.)

## Logging and Diagnostics

### Enable Verbose Logging
1. Open Degoogled Android Auto app
2. Go to Settings > Developer Options
3. Enable "Verbose Logging"
4. Enable "Export Logs"

### Export Connection Logs
```bash
# Via ADB
adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.degoogled.androidauto/files/logs/

# Or use app's export feature:
# Settings > Diagnostics > Export Logs
```

### Log Analysis
Key log patterns to look for:
- `USB_DETECTION`: Device/accessory detection events
- `ACCESSORY_HANDSHAKE`: Protocol negotiation
- `AUTHENTICATION`: Security handshake steps
- `Nissan Pathfinder Compatibility`: Vehicle-specific checks

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Protocol Handler**: Framework only - needs full Android Auto protocol implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **USB Communication**: Detection working, data transfer needs implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **App Projection**: Service stubs created, full projection system needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Authentication**: Simulation only - real handshake protocol required

### Nissan-Specific Limitations
- **Wireless Android Auto**: Not supported natively (requires aftermarket dongle)
- **Multiple Phones**: Only one phone can be connected at a time
- **Background Apps**: Limited background processing while Android Auto is active
- **System Integration**: Some vehicle functions may not integrate with degoogled apps

### Privacy Considerations
- **No Google Services**: App doesn't communicate with Google servers
- **Local Processing**: Voice commands and data processing kept on-device
- **Minimal Telemetry**: Only essential connection logging (can be disabled)

## Development Status

### Completed Features ‚úÖ
- USB device/accessory detection and filtering
- Nissan Pathfinder display optimization
- Comprehensive logging system
- Authentication framework with fallback logic
- Touch target and font scaling optimization
- APK signing and installation fixes

### In Progress üîÑ
